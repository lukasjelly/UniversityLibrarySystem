# Welcome to my University Library System Project
 
## Project Summary
The library system allows users to search for library items, check their availability, and place holds on them. It also allows librarians to add and remove library items, manage the holds list, and check out library items to patrons. The system is written in C# and utilizes object-oriented programming concepts such as classes, objects, and inheritance to model the different entities in the library such as books, patrons, and librarians. The application provides a command line interface that allows for easy navigation and management of library resources.
The library data is recorded in library.txt however at this stage the application only supports read-only.
